# Widget Mirror
Collection of useful dashboard widgets

## What does it do?
Adds some, hopefully useful, dashboard widgets. For a detailed explanation see below.

## Installation
Use composer to add the extension:
```
composer require "sitegeist/widget-mirror"
```
* Flush Caches
* Configure the max size for the default storage

## Configuration
### Storage size

This extension adds a field to the storage record to configure the desired maximum storage size.
Go to `List => [ROOT] => File Storage` and edit the default storage (normally, this should be the fileadmin).
There is a new tab called "Widget mirror" with a new field where you can enter a value in bytes.

**Please note:** This value is only used for displaying how much space is used. There is no real limit.

## Widgets
### Storage usage
Shows the used storage size in percent from the configured maximum.

### Biggest unused files
Shows the top 10 biggest files that are not used.
(Entries from sys_file that do not have an entry in sys_refindex)

### Duplicate files
Shows a list of suspected, duplicated files based on the sha1-hash from sys_file.

### Last changed pages
Simply a list of the last 10 edited pages that are accessible by the current backend user.

### Latest redirects
The last 10 updated redirects.

### Broken links
Shows a list of all broken links with page, element, target and error message.

**Please note:** For this widget the core extension typo3/cms-linkvalidator must be installed and active as the list is taken directly from the LinkValidator table.
